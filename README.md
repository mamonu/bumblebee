## Getting Started


TODO: add when ready

     title="structure" >


### Prerequisites


This package is compatible with Linux/OSX systems


#### What package prerequsites you need to install the software ? 

See [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mamonu/bumblebee/blob/master/requirements.txt) 


#### How to install those prerequisite packages if you need to?

Most prerequisite packages will be installed automaticaly.

However the spellcheck submodule uses the enchant system library.If this library is not there then pyenchant will not work.

On an Ubuntu / Debian system that means that you should run on your bash shell:   `sudo apt-get install enchant`

On a RedHat / CentOS / Cloudera CDH system that means you should run on your bash shell:   `sudo yum install enchant`

On OSX you need to run `brew install enchant`


After that the fastest way to make sure you have everything would be go to main directory and run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon stopwords wordnet brown_tei gutenberg punkt popular
```

after downloading these packages and their assorted material (in the case of NLTK) everything should run smoothly.
If not please open an issue here on this repo.



### Installing

TODO: add when ready.. This is still in dev testing / alpha stage. Plan is after code review to 
upload to PYPI. (So at some point its going to be `pip install nlpbumblebee` or something similar... )

For the time being git clone the repo and enter:

`python setup.py install`



## Running the tests

((you will need pytest intalled. if you dont have it the just  :  `pip install pytest pytest-cov`    )

In order to run all the automated tests for this system  after you have cloned it into your system just do:

```
cd tests

pytest -v   ## run all tests

cd ..

pytest -v --cov=nlpfunctions tests/      ## run tests and calculate testing coverage 


```


## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team 
integrate their work on a main repo frequently. Usually each person integrates their work at least daily
leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build 
(that includes running an automated test harness) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. 
Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems 
and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.

<br>

We are using Travis CI <img src="https://github.com/mamonu/bumblebee/blob/master/pics/travis.png" title="travis logo" width="50" height="50">       for this process. 



## Documentation

Curently there is automaticaly created documentation supported by sphinx-docs. This documentation is also availiable 
Additionaly there is a \examples folder where simple tasks using functions from this package are described.
